NOTE: This is somewhat outdated repository (at least as far as
externally usable bits are concerned as it's main user is just me
these days). I recommend checking out www.homewrt.org (and
hnetd/ohybridproxy/whatever else we get into OpenWrt routing feed).

This is the master package for the whole hnet effort. It tracks the
sub-repositories as git submodules, and provides convenience
facilities for:

- simple 'general setup' framework (see INSTALL file for details)

- setting up custom NetKit environment (amd64-arch with Linux 3.8, and
  wheezy Debian)

 (make netkit.build)

- building OpenWRT UML image which has the 'useful bits' for hnet (+
  Netkit integration)

 (make openwrt.build)

- network topology utilities
 
 (pending)

- updating the OpenWRT feed based on the most recent version of the components

 (component/ => openwrt/feed/*/Makefile automatic update)

 (pending)

- advanced use case: OWRT with hnet for router, instead of UML

  # make openwrt.build
  # (cd openwrt/dist && make menuconfig && make) 
  => choose your router model
  .. and enjoy the binaries in openwrt/dist/bin/
