* Instructions to install from scratch

** Requirements

Debian 7.0 (wheezy) (amd64)
~default installation (desktop) + sudo

Debian 8.0 (jessie) (amd64)
~default installation (desktop) + sudo

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (amd64)
~default installation

Other versions may also work; please let me know if you have success
with similar instructions. Tested only with amd64, probably works
also with x86.

** Disclaimer

These instructions are a work in progress. Please check the
problems and solutions section below, if you encounter a problem while
following them.

** Steps

# sudo apt-get install git

 (if you don't have it already)

# git clone --recursive git://github.com/fingon/hnet.git

# make setup-debianish

.. re-login if you weren't part of 'disk' group before ..

Note: sudo should be also configured for your account for the
following steps to work; on typical Ubuntu 12.04 installation it
should work out of the box, in case of Debian, you have to add
yourself to sudoers group using 'usermod -a -G sudoers <userid>' as
root after installing it.

# make

.. this takes a long while (it should be safe to use -j <N>, -s, or
whatever with this too if desirable; OpenWrt build is -j enabled by default
anyway, so time savings from using -j here are not that significant) ..

If it completes, your environment is set up correctly. Congratulations.

To start a sample NetKit lab, type 

# make demo.start

and to stop it,

# make demo.stop

** Extra steps for real development

You probably want to add NETKIT_HOME environment variable, and add
$NETKIT_HOME/bin to your PATH, if you actually use this for real; see
demo_{start,stop}.sh.

* Problems and solutions

** Incorrect permissions

*** Symptom

losetup: no permission to look at /dev/loop<N>
-e 
\e[1m\e[32m====== Creating partition table... =======\e[0m
loop: can't get info on device X/hnet/netkit/fs/netkit-fs-amd64-F5.2-wheezy: Inappropriate ioctl for device

*** Solution

make setup-X should have added you to group, but have to re-log-in for
change to get into effect

** OpenWRT compilation issues

*** eglibc + make bug

If the build fails under openwrt/dist/ when compiling eglibc, the problem
is in GNU make ( https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?39934 ).

To address that, do

# cd openwrt/dist && make

Note that this may take a LONG TIME to complete. After it has completed,
redo the hnet make after that.

** Flaky netkit filesystem creation script

*** Symptom

losetup: /dev/loop0: device is busy
make[2]: *** [.fs_created] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `X/hnet/netkit/fs'
...

*** Solution

run make again (...)

*** Symptom

Failed to fetch http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian/pool/main/<something>_amd64.deb  Could not resolve 'ftp.fi.debian.org'
make[2]: *** [.full_system_installed] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/ubuntu/hnet/netkit/fs'
make[1]: *** [fs.build] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/ubuntu/hnet/netkit'
make: *** [netkit.build] Error 2

*** Solution

You encountered transient DNS failure. run make again.
